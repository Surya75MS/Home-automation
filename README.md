# Home-automation
Home automation is building automation for a home, called a smart home or smart house. A home automation system will monitor and/or control home attributes such as lighting, climate, entertainment systems, and appliances. It may also include home security such as access control and alarm systems. It typically connects controlled devices to a central hub or "gateway". The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a vast number of “things” that are connected to the internet so they can share data with other things – IoT applications, connected devices, industrial machines and more. Internet-connected devices use built-in sensors to collect data and, in some cases, act on it.  We have used nodemcu wifi microcontroller as the heart of the project and a 5V relay module as a switch to control the tubelight. We have used a power bank to power the hardware. Nodemcu is connected to the local blynk server and hence can communicate with the mobile enabled via wifi. We have also hosted a local blynk server on the laptop to which we have connected mobile. We can also see the backend details of the users connected to the server. The project can be further developed by being able to connect the hardware by multiple devices from any part of the world.
